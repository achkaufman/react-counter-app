# React Counter App

## Overview

A basic counter with increment and decrement functionality, built on a starter React project created with npx.

## Install and Run

First run `npm install` in the root directory to install dependencies, then `npm start` to start the app.

## Learnings

This project was created to learn the process for creating a new React application using the command `npx create-react-app react-counter-app --template typescript`.

Additionally, it was used to experiment with the following basic features of React learned in a Udemy course:
- Components and props
- State and lifecycle (useState and useEffect for the counter and buttons)
- Conditional rendering (to update the text at the bottom of the page)
